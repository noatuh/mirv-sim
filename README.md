# MIRV Simulator 🚀🌎

**A visually immersive, interactive simulation of Multiple Independent Reentry Vehicle (MIRV) launches, impacts, and effects on a 3D globe.**

---

## Features

- 🌍 **Realistic 3D Earth** with clouds, stars, and atmospheric effects
- 🗺️ **Lat/Lon Grid & Country Borders** (toggleable overlays)
- 🖱️ **Interactive Launch/Target Selection** (Shift+Click or precise lat/lon input)
- 🎯 **Warhead Spread Control** (adjustable dispersion radius)
- 💥 **Blast Effects Visualization** (Fireball, Radiation, Thermal, Blast zones)
- 📍 **Impact Logging** (lat/lon, copyable)
- 🛠️ **Modern UI** (menu panels, toggles, sliders)
- 🛰️ **Accurate Coordinate System** (hover to see lat/lon anywhere)

---

## Quick Start

1. **Clone or Download** this repo
2. **Open `globe.html` in your browser** (no build required)
3. **Explore:**
	- Set launch/target by Shift+Click or lat/lon
	- Adjust warhead count, yield, spread, and detonation type
	- Toggle overlays: stars, grid, borders, blast effects
	- Launch MIRV and watch the simulation unfold

## Tech Stack

- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) for 3D rendering
- [world-atlas](https://github.com/topojson/world-atlas) for country borders
- [TopoJSON](https://github.com/topojson/topojson-client) for parsing borders
- Pure HTML/CSS/JS (no build tools required)

---

## Advanced Controls

- **Target Spread:** Control how tightly warheads cluster around the target
- **Blast Effects:** Toggle each effect zone (Fireball, Radiation, etc.)
- **Lat/Lon Grid:** See precise coordinates anywhere on the globe
- **Country Borders:** Visualize political boundaries
- **Impact List:** Copy lat/lon of any impact for analysis
